# GO BLOX Bot System

A comprehensive Discord bot management system with a web-based control panel. Features dual bot architecture (self-bot monitoring + official bot forwarding) with database-driven configuration, multiple server support, and extensive moderation/management features.

## Architecture

### Self-Bot (`backend/self-bot/`)
- **Purpose**: Monitors source Discord servers for new messages
- **Technology**: `discord.js-selfbot-v13`
- **Functionality**: 
  - Listens to configured source channels from database
  - Processes messages and sends data to official bot via webhook
  - Syncs server/channel/role data to database
  - Multiple self-bots can connect to one official bot

### Official Bot (`backend/official-bot/`)
- **Purpose**: Forwards messages, manages server features, and provides interactive interface
- **Technology**: `discord.js` (official bot API)
- **Functionality**:
  - Receives message data from self-bot(s) via webhook server
  - Forwards messages to target channels with role mentions
  - Welcomes new users with random messages
  - Thanks server boosters with custom messages
  - Provides interactive button-based interface
  - Tracks moderation actions (bans, unbans, kicks)
  - Manages custom supporter roles
  - AFK system with voice mute/deafen
  - Leveling system with XP tracking and leaderboards
  - Giveaway system with role restrictions and multiple entries
  - Feedback submission system
  - Role-based permission system
  - Syncs server/channel/role data to database
  - Timezone-aware operations (configurable via TIMEZONE environment variable)

### Control Panel (`frontend/`)
- **Purpose**: Web-based management interface for all bots
- **Technology**: Express.js with session-based authentication
- **Functionality**:
  - Create and manage multiple bots (official + self-bots)
  - Start/stop/restart bots remotely
  - Configure all bot settings via web interface
  - View bot status, uptime, and process information
  - Manage server configurations per bot
  - Configure forwarder, welcomer, booster, permissions, giveaway, leveling, and more
  - View bot logs in real-time terminal interface with auto-scroll
  - Server list pagination (10 servers per page)
  - Server overview dashboard with comprehensive statistics
  - Enhanced member list with advanced filtering, sorting, and search
  - Visual embed builder with live preview and image upload
  - Mobile-responsive design throughout

### Localization & User Preferences (`backend/i18n.js`, `backend/locales/`)
- **Multi-language support**: Built-in translation files for English and Bahasa Indonesia with easy JSON overrides
- **Per-member language**: Each member's preferred language is stored in `server_members.language` and respected across embeds, errors, and buttons
- **User preferences**: The in-discord ⚙️ Settings button lets members toggle level-up DM notifications (`server_member_levels.dm_notifications_enabled`) and change languages at any time
- **Extensible**: Add additional locale files under `backend/locales/` and they automatically appear in the Settings selector

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+ recommended) OR Docker & Docker Compose
- MySQL/MariaDB database (local or remote)
- Discord bot token(s)
- Discord application ID (for official bots)

## Quick Start with Docker (Recommended)

### 1. Clone and Configure
```bash
# Use .env.dev for development or .env.production for production
# Edit the appropriate .env file and set your values:
# - DB_ROOT_PASSWORD (for MariaDB)
# - DB_NAME, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD
# - SESSION_SECRET (generate with: openssl rand -base64 32)
# - CONTROL_PANEL_PORT (default: 8080)
# - TIMEZONE (optional, defaults to Asia/Jakarta)
```

### 2. Start with Docker Compose
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will:
- Build the application image
- Start MariaDB database container
- Start the application container
- Automatically create database tables

### 3. Access Control Panel
Open your browser: `http://localhost:8080` (or your configured port)

### 4. View Logs
```bash
docker-compose logs -f
```

### Common Docker Commands
```bash
# Stop containers
docker-compose down

# Restart containers
docker-compose restart

# Rebuild after code changes
docker-compose up -d --build

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f app
docker-compose logs -f database
```

## Manual Setup (Without Docker)

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables
Use `.env.dev` for development or `.env.production` for production. Configure the appropriate file:

```env
# MySQL/MariaDB Configuration (Required)
# Option 1: Use DATABASE_URL
DATABASE_URL=mysql://user:password@host:port/database

# Option 2: Use individual variables
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
DB_USER=your_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_NAME=goblox_bot

# Control Panel Configuration (Required)
CONTROL_PANEL_PORT=8080
SESSION_SECRET=your-random-secret-key

# Timezone Configuration (Optional)
# Defaults to Asia/Jakarta if not set
# Used for all date/time operations (giveaways, timestamps, etc.)
# Examples: "Asia/Jakarta", "Asia/Singapore", "America/New_York", "Europe/London"
TIMEZONE=Asia/Jakarta
```

**For Remote Database (SSH Tunnel):**
1. Create SSH tunnel: `ssh -p PORT -L 3306:localhost:3306 user@host`
2. Use `localhost:3306` in your DATABASE_URL

### 3. Initialize Database
The database will be automatically initialized when you start the control panel. Tables will be created automatically from `database/schema.sql` on first startup.

Alternatively, you can manually run the SQL schema:
1. Connect to your MySQL/MariaDB database
2. Copy and paste the contents of `database/schema.sql`
3. Execute the SQL

- Real-time communication for instant message forwarding
- Each official bot can have its own port (multiple bots supported)

## Configuration

### Database-Driven Configuration
**All configuration is stored in MySQL/MariaDB database** - no file editing required!

Configuration is managed through:
1. **Web Control Panel**: Primary method for all settings
2. **Database**: Settings stored in `server_settings` table with JSON

- Level-up DM notification preferences live in `server_member_levels.dm_notifications_enabled` and are toggled via the Settings button

## Testing vs Production Mode

- **Testing Mode** (`is_testing: true`): Uses test channels for safe testing
- **Production Mode** (`is_testing: false`): Uses production channels for full functionality
- Mode is set per official bot in the control panel
- Self-bots automatically inherit mode from their connected official bot
- Easy switching between modes via web interface

## Security Features

1. **Panel Authentication**: Password-protected control panel with session management
2. **Secret Key Authentication**: Webhook requires `X-Secret-Key` header
3. **Unauthorized Access Logging**: Failed authentication attempts are logged
4. **Secure Communication**: Only self-bot with correct secret key can send data
5. **Token Isolation**: Self-bot and official bot use different tokens
6. **Separation of Concerns**: Self-bot only monitors, official bot only forwards
7. **Process Verification**: Bot status verified against actual running processes

## Troubleshooting

### Database Issues
1. **Tables not found**: 
   - Ensure database connection is configured in `.env`
   - Database will auto-create tables on first startup
   - Or manually run `database/schema.sql` in your MySQL client

2. **Connection errors**: 
   - Verify database credentials in `.env`
   - Check database server is running
   - For remote databases, ensure SSH tunnel is active (if using)
   - Verify network connectivity to database server

### Bot Issues
1. **Bot won't start**: 
   - Check bot token is valid
   - Verify bot has required permissions in Discord
   - Check application ID is correct for official bots
   - Review control panel logs for errors

2. **Self-bot not receiving messages**: 
   - Verify forwarder configuration in control panel
   - Check source channel IDs are correct
   - Ensure self-bot is in the source server
   - Check self-bot token is valid

3. **Official bot not forwarding**: 
   - Verify forwarder configuration (target channels, roles)
   - Check webhook server is running (check port)
   - Verify secret key matches between self-bot and official bot
   - Check official bot has permissions in target channels

4. **Communication issues**: 
   - Verify webhook URL and port configuration
   - Check secret key matches
   - Ensure both bots are running
   - Check firewall/network settings for localhost
   - Verify webhook server is listening on the configured port

5. **Sync issues**: 
   - Sync runs on first bot startup only (when no servers exist in database)
   - After first startup, sync only runs on Discord events (guild joins, channel changes, role changes, etc.)
   - No periodic syncs - database is only accessed when Discord events occur

### Control Panel Issues
1. **Can't login**: 
   - If first time, register a password
   - Check password is correct
   - View login logs in database (`panel_logs` table)

2. **Interface not loading**: 
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify control panel server is running
   - Check port is not blocked by firewall

3. **Bot status not updating**: 
   - Refresh the page
   - Check bot process is actually running
   - Verify database connection

### Feature Issues
1. **Interface not appearing**: 
   - Use `/interface #channel` to create the interface
   - Requires Administrator permissions

2. **Permission errors**: 
   - Verify permission roles are configured in control panel
   - Check user has required role in Discord
   - Ensure roles are synced to database

3. **Leveling not working**: 
   - Verify member roles are configured in permissions
   - Check user has member role
   - Ensure leveling component is initialized

4. **Giveaway not working**: 
   - Verify giveaway channel is configured in control panel
   - Check user has required permission role (Staff+ by default)
   - Ensure giveaway component is initialized
   - Verify timezone is configured correctly (TIMEZONE environment variable)
   - Check giveaway message exists and hasn't been deleted

## Development

### Project Structure
- Modular component-based architecture
- Database-driven configuration (no hardcoded settings)
- Type: ES Modules (`"type": "module"` in package.json)

### Adding New Features
1. Create component in appropriate directory (`backend/official-bot/components/` or `backend/self-bot/components/`)
2. Export init function and any handlers
3. Import and initialize in bot entry point
4. Add configuration to database schema if needed
5. Add UI controls in control panel if needed
